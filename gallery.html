<p>Some visual tastes are:

<p>We believe we are the originators of the Kalua Double Pig sandwich:</p>

Featuring: Kalua Pig (Hawaiian style Pulled-Pork), 2 Bacon Strips, our Pineapple accented BBQ sauce, creamy Pineapple Coleslaw, topped with Cilantro, all on a toasted Hoagie Roll, served open-faced.

<br>Another original Sandwich is our BSSST:

It's a Pacific Northwest spin on the classic BLT. Instead we combine Bacon, Smoked Salmon, Spinach & Tomato, simply dress the roll with mayonnaise but grace it with dill to add a fresh twist to the perfectly balanced flavors.
